This plugin makes it easy to add a user system to your website.
You can use the built-in user database and data model, or you may supply your own.

To use the built-in user table:
1. Enable the extension in your web application Config/More/Extensions.syrp file
2. Add a login form to any page, with two fields named "Username"|"EmailAddress" and "Password"*#
3. Add a registration form to any page, with three fields "Username"|"EmailAddress", "Password", and "PasswordConfirm"*%@

*You can use your own field names by specifying them in the extension config
#You can instead use the LoginForm or MicroLoginForm controls
%You can instead use the RegistrationForm control
@If you use EmailAddress on the registration form, you'll also need an EmailAddressConfirm


To use your own (or a 3rd party) user table:
1. Enable the extension in your web application Config/More/Extensions.syrp file
2. When you enable the extension in step one using \Wafl\Core::AddExtension(), you'll get an extension instance.  
	Call this method on it: Set_UserClass($customUserClassName) (and optionally Set_UserGroupClass)^
4. Add a login form to any page, with two fields named "Username"|"EmailAddress" and "Password"*#
5. Add a registration form to any page, with three fields "Username"|"EmailAddress", "Password", and "PasswordConfirm"*%@

^Your custom user class must implement IUserGroupSavableUser and your customer user group class must implement ISavableUserGroup
*You can use your own field names by specifying them in the extension config
#You can instead use the LoginForm or MicroLoginForm controls
%You can instead use the RegistrationForm control
@If you use EmailAddress on the registration form, you'll also need an EmailAddressConfirm
